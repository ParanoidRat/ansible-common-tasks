# Prevent upgrade for installed package in either RedHat- or Debian-based OS.
# -   respects version spec only for RedHat (e.g. `package-1.1`)
# -   for Debian, version is stripped if present (e.g. `package=1.1`) and
#     package is held at the current version
#
#  Usage example
#
#  tasks:
#    - import_tasks: tasks/task_hold-pkg.yml
#      vars:
#        hold_pkg_name: syslog-ng
