# Adds a repository and corresponding GPG key to the OS. For Debian family repo
# definition could be milti-line and must include full repo string
# (e.g. deb <url> release repo). For RedHat family repo definition is a URL.
#
# Usage example
#
# tasks:
#   - import_tasks: task_add-repo.yml
#     vars:
#       add_repo_name: "Elastic-5.x"
#       add_repo_url_key: "https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch"
#       add_repo_definition:
#         - deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/5.x/apt stable main
#         - deb https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/4.x/apt stable main
